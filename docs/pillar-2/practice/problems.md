# Algorithm Practice Problems

## Problem Categories

### Array & String Problems
- **Two Sum variations**: Two Sum, 3Sum, 4Sum
- **Sliding Window**: Longest Substring, Maximum Subarray
- **String Manipulation**: Valid Palindrome, Group Anagrams

### Tree & Graph Problems  
- **Tree Traversal**: Inorder, Preorder, Level Order
- **Binary Search Tree**: Validate BST, Lowest Common Ancestor
- **Graph Algorithms**: Number of Islands, Course Schedule

### System Design Context
- **Rate Limiter**: Token bucket, sliding window algorithms
- **LRU Cache**: Doubly linked list + hash map
- **Consistent Hashing**: Distribute keys across nodes

## Staff-Level Focus
Focus on problems that appear in real systems:
- How would you implement this at scale?
- What are the space/time trade-offs?
- How does this algorithm perform under different data distributions?
