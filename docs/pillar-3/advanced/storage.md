# Distributed Storage Systems

## Learning Objectives
- Understand distributed storage architectures
- Compare replication vs sharding strategies
- Design storage systems for different consistency requirements

## Key Topics
- **Replication**: Master-slave, multi-master, peer-to-peer
- **Sharding**: Horizontal partitioning strategies
- **Consistency Models**: Strong vs eventual consistency
- **Storage Engines**: LSM-trees, B+ trees, append-only logs

## Real-World Examples
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Global tables and cross-region replication
- **Google Spanner**: Globally distributed database with strong consistency
- **Apache Cassandra**: Peer-to-peer, eventually consistent
